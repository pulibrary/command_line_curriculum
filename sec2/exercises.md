## Exercises for Files and Directories 

The following exercises should help you feel comfortable manipulating files and creating and navigating directories on the command line. Instead of creating files and folders on your Desktop, for example, we will do this via the command line. 

1. First, create three new directories in your home folder called Food, Pets, and     Family. (Hint: Use the ```mkdir``` command) 

2. Do an ```ls``` to make sure your directories are listed. 

3. In the ```Food``` directory, create three text files called ```recipe1.txt, recipe2.txt, and recipe3.txt```. Try using just one command to create all three.

4. In the Pets directory, create three image files called ```pet1.png, pet2.png, pet3.png```. Try using just one command to create all three.

5. In the Family directory, create three video files called ```family1.mov, family2.mov, and family3.mov```. Try using just one command to create all three.

6. Go back to your home directory and do an ```ls -al``` to see all files you’ve created. 

7. Create subdirectories: 
    - In the Food directory, create a subdirectory called ```Cooking```. 
    - In the Pets directory, create a subdirectory called ```Dogs```. 
    - In the Family directory, create a subdirectory called ```Vacations```. 

8. Move ```recipe1.txt and recipe3.txt``` into the ```Cooking``` directory. 

9. Copy ```pet2.png``` into the ```Dogs``` directory.

10. Move all three ```family[x].mov``` files into the ```Vacations``` directory using one command. 

11. Rename the ```family1.mov``` file to a new name called ```beach_trip.mov.```

12. Go back to your home directory and check that everything is now where you’ve placed it. 

13. You realized that ```recipe2.txt``` is a blank file. Delete it from the directory.

14. Now that you're finished, you want to make sure there is at least one copy of each file in its original directory.
