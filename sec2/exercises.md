## Exercises for Files and Directories 

The following exercises should help you feel comfortable manipulating files and creating and navigating directories on the command line. Instead of creating files and folders on your Desktop, for example, we will do this via the command line. 

### Scenario

It's the end of the term and your Desktop is a mess! Let's organize your course files so that you can find them more easily in the future. 

1. First, create three new directories in your home folder called Computer_Science, Studio_Art, and Filmmaking. (Hint: Use the ```mkdir``` command) 

2. Do an ```ls``` to make sure your directories are listed. 

3. In the ```Computer_Science``` directory, create three files called ```project.json, code.rb, and config.yaml```. Try using just one command to create all three.

4. In the ```Studio_Art``` directory, create three image files called ```image.png, sculpture.pdf, ceramics.jpeg```. Try using just one command to create all three.

5. In the ```Filmmaking``` directory, create three video files called ```family.mov, friends.mov, and pets.mov```. Try using just one command to create all three.

6. Go back to your home directory and do an ```ls -al``` to see all files you’ve created. 

7. Create subdirectories: 
    - In the Computer_Science directory, create a subdirectory called ```Programs```. 
    - In the Studio_Art directory, create a subdirectory called ```Exhibits```. 
    - In the Filmmaking directory, create a subdirectory called ```Screenings```. 

8. Move ```project.json and code.rb``` into the ```Programs``` directory. 

9. Copy ```sculpture.pdf``` into the ```Exhibits``` directory.

10. Move all three ```.mov``` files into the ```Screenings``` directory using one command. 

11. Rename the ```pets.mov``` file to a new name called ```dog_tricks.mov.```

12. Go back to your home directory and check that everything is now where you’ve placed it. 

13. You realized that ```config.yaml``` is a blank file. Delete it from the directory.

14. Now that you're finished, you want to make sure there is at least one copy of each file in its original directory. 

Congrats on organizing your Desktop!
