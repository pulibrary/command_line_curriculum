#  Miscellaneous Unix Commands

For the rest of the curriculum we will look at Unix commands the instructor thinks you will encounter. In designing this I lumped the next section into "filters" and "file archiving and networking commands". These are the ones I couldn't neatly fit in those two.

The commands we will look at are:

1. [`bc`](sec5/bc.md) : Calculator
1. [`cal`](sec5/cal.md) : Display the calendar
1. [`date`](sec5/date.md) : Display the current date
1. [`du`](sec5/du.md) : Disk usage
1. [`echo`](sec5/echo.md) : Print a line of output
1. [`find`](sec5/find.md) : Find a file in the file system
1. [`sudo`](sec5/sudo.md) : Execute a command as another user
1. [`uptime`](sec5/uptime.md): Show system load and system status
1. [`wc`](sec5/wc.md) : Display number of lines, words, and characters in a file
1. [`who`](sec5/who.md) : Show who is working on the system
