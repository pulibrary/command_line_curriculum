# Command Line Curriculum

This repository is an upgrade of a workshop provided to a regional [Code4Lib Conference](https://gitlab.com/kayiwa/cli_workshop)

Command Line Curriculum

There are many benefits of using the command line including these below:
 * We can control systems that donâ€™t have any graphical environment installed, including remote servers, virtual machines, and containers
 * Programs executed on the command line can be combined so that the output of one program can be the input of another.
 * Task automation is built-in thanks to the scripting nature of many shells. No more doing repetitive tasks manually.


The workshop will focus on the user and programming interface of the UNIX Operating System. The target audience for the workshops is neophytes who are completely new to the command line and unix. The structure of the workshop is to remain self-driven with some guidance. This nature of this repo will be a "live" document that will be improved on by those who find bits of it missing. Pull requests are therefore most welcome.

It is possible to use your UNIX-Like Operating System installation. For PUL users ask for a sandbox throw away VM to use this. For others we will be using Ubuntu's "Jammy Jellyfish" in our examples below.

We will use the following [Plan](plan.md)
