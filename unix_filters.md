# Unix filters

Unix relies heavily on filters to sort files and search for keywords in a file. A **filter** is a command that takes some input, transforms the data and sends it out as output. 
We will look at the following in this section:

* [`awk`](sec6/awk.md) : Pattern scanning and processing
* [`grep`](sec6/grep.md) : Search for a keyword
* [`head`](sec6/head.md) : Display the beginning part of a file
* [`sort`](sec6/sort.md) : Sort information
* [`tail`](sec6/tail.md) : Display the last part of a file
* [`tee`](sec6/tee.md) : Record data to standard output
